Cyber Fraud App Detection Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

The Cyber Fraud App Detection project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of identifying fraudulent or malicious mobile applications. By analyzing app features, permissions, behaviors, and user reviews, the system helps prevent cyber fraud and enhances user security.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to automatically classify mobile applications as fraudulent or legitimate using machine learning techniques. This proactive detection minimizes the risk of financial and privacy losses caused by malicious apps.

Problem Statement

The rapid growth of mobile applications has increased the risk of cyber fraud. Malicious apps can:
Steal sensitive information
Perform unauthorized actions
Manipulate financial transactions
Manual detection methods are often inefficient and fail against sophisticated attacks. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning for automatic app classification.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression
Datasets: Drebin Dataset (Android malware dataset), Kaggle Android malware datasets

Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather app data including permissions, API calls, and user reviews.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
3. Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that indicate fraudulent or malicious behavior.
4. Model Training: Train machine learning models using the labeled dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Deployment (Optional): Develop a simple interface or script to classify new apps.

Expected Outcome

A machine learning model capable of accurately classifying apps as fraudulent or legitimate.
Visualizations demonstrating feature importance and model performance metrics.
Enhanced user security through proactive detection of malicious applications.

Applications

Mobile app marketplaces for automatic fraud detection
Enterprise security systems for mobile device protection
Research in cybersecurity and malware analysis
